DISABLE_IP_LOCK_LABEL=Disable IP Lock
DISABLE_IP_LOCK_HELP=By default, when you log in your IP address is stored in your authentication cookie, and the system will not allow access from another IP address without logging in again.  This is a security measure which prevents an attacker from stealing your authentication cookie and re-using it to gain access to the system.<br/><br/>However, some ISPs or VPNs will change the client's external IP address frequently (or sometimes even for each new request) in an attempt to maintain privacy, but which breaks this system's IP lock security measures.  If you are unable to fully load the system after logging in, or if you get errors shortly after logging in, this may be what is happening.<br/><br/>By clicking this checkbox, you choose to disable the IP lock security measure for this session.
